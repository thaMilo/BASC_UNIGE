# Exploitation assignment

In this assignment, we review everything we have studied so far about software
vulnerabilities and exploitation:
you will have to reverse engineer programs (without source code or symbols)
to understand what they do and which vulnerabilities they contain.
To better assess their vulnerabilities, do not forget to check which mitigations
are enabled in each binary.

The assignment consists of three challenges, described in the following sections.
Each student gets their own customized vulnerable programs (find yours in the
full archive on AulaWeb, `pwn_student_binaries.tar.xz`, which also contains
the 32/64-bit libc used on the remote server).

Once you identify a possible vulnerability, you should analyze it to see if it
is really exploitable. If it is, write an exploit script to prove it.
If you think the vulnerability is there but cannot land a successful exploit,
describe the situation in your report, analyzing what is going wrong.

If you successfully solve a challenge, you'll find a flag in the remote service,
in the usual format `BASC{...}`.

IMPORTANT:

- remote services can be reached only via the VPN (check previous assignments
  for instructions on how to connect)
- *brute-forcing is never required* to solve these challenges: please **do not
  perform a Denial-of-Service attack** to our poor server.

You must write a detailed report describing the results of your analysis, in particular:

- what tools did you use, and how
- the weakness/vulnerabilities that you found, even if you did not manage to
  exploit them
- the exploits that you crafted and their requirements/constraints/limitations,
  if any

Remember that the easiest way to exploit a remote service is to develop a local
exploit first, since you have complete control of the execution environment and
can use a debugger to check what is going on.

Happy *pwning* :-)

## Call me - port: (base-port+10)

As the name suggests, you should probably call some function (with the correct arguments)
to make the service print a flag. Are there any other flags? Maybe...

## The answer - port: (base-port+11)

There is a unique answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.
BTW, `0xbadc0ffe` isn'it.

Warning: Ghidra's decompiler sometimes (it depends on the Ghidra version) tries too hard to be clever and may "optimize" (=hide/remove) something it shouldn't.
So, do not blindly trust its output and take a look at the assembly view as well.

## Really Optimized Primality-test - port: (base-port+12)

*Really Optimized Primality-test* is a service that can tell you whether a number
is prime or not.
Well, being extremely optimized, if the service tells you that a number is not
a prime then you can be sure, otherwise well... let's say it depends ;)

Anyway, the flag is in the usual place. Can you read the flag?

**Hint**: the simplest/most-direct solution does *not* leverage a ret-to-libc attack. Pay attention at the challenge name ;)
